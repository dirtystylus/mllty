## Getting Started

### 1. Clone this Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog.git my-blog-name
```

### 2. Navigate to the directory

```
cd my-blog-name
```

Specifically have a look at `eleventy.config.js` to see if you want to configure any Eleventy options differently.

### 3. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### 4. Edit \_data/metadata.json

### 5. Run Eleventy

```
npx @11ty/eleventy
```

Or build and host locally for local development

```
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

Or in debug mode:

```
DEBUG=Eleventy* npx @11ty/eleventy
```

### Implementation Notes

- `about/index.md` is an example of a content page.
- `blog/` has the blog posts but really they can live in any directory. They need only the `post` tag to be included in the blog posts [collection](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/).
- Use the `eleventyNavigation` key in your front matter to add a template to the top level site navigation. This is in use on `index.njk` and `about/index.md`.
  - This makes use of the [Eleventy Navigation plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/)
- Content can be any template format (blog posts neednâ€™t be markdown, for example). Configure your supported templates in `eleventy.config.js` -> `templateFormats`.
- The `public` folder in your input directory will be copied to the output folder (via `addPassthroughCopy` in the `eleventy.config.js` file). This means `./public/css/*` will live at `./_site/css/*` after your build completes.
- The blog post feed template is in `feed/feed.njk`. This is also a good example of using a global data files in that it uses `_data/metadata.json`.
- This project uses three layouts:
  - `_includes/layouts/base.njk`: the top level HTML structure
  - `_includes/layouts/home.njk`: the home page template (wrapped into `base.njk`)
  - `_includes/layouts/post.njk`: the blog post template (wrapped into `base.njk`)
- `_includes/postslist.njk` is a Nunjucks include and is a reusable component used to display a list of all the posts. `index.njk` has an example of how to use it.
