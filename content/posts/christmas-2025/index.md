Down to Bethesda, MD for the Christmas holiday. A bit of a quieter celebration — Jordan’s father had recently undergone surgery so we ended up splitting time between Bethesda and Vienna, VA.

My brother-in-law Jamie led most of the cooking for the holiday, the biggest production being the Feast of the Seven Fishes on Christmas Eve.
