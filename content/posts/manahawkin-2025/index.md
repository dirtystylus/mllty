In August we took our yearly trip to Manahawkin, NJ (and neighboring Long Beach Island) for our late summer Llobrera family reunion and birthday celebration. This was a special year, with my older brother Joseph celebrating his 50th birthday. My sister-in-law and I also celebrated our non-milestone birthdays.

My wife and I collect photos of license plate puns. We didn’t see too many interesting ones on this trip but we did spot a couple during our walks around the neighborhood.

## Atlantic City

Due to hurricane Erin the weather was too rough to go swimming on the ocean side of Long Beach Island during most of our stay, so we went swimming on the bay side and hung out at the beach house. We did take a day trip to the Atlantic City boardwalk, which I had never visited. It was a sad affair, with lots of run-down storefronts and closures.

## Celebrations

On our final day at the beach nobody could get into the water, so we flew a kite. Later we went to dinner to celebrate Joseph’s 50th.
