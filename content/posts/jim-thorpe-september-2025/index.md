A quick trip to Jim Thorpe, the self-described “Switzerland of America”. It’s…not that, for sure, but it was fun to finally ride the rails with the kids along the Lehigh River Gorge. We were familiar with the town from past Girl Scout camps at nearby [Camp Mosey Wood](https://www.gsep.org/en/members/for-girl-scouts/camp-and-outdoors/resident-camps/camp-mosey-wood.html).

The train ride with the [Lehigh Gorge Scenic Railway](https://www.lgsry.com)^[Jordan and I had ridden the train a couple of years ago, but this was the first time the kids got to experience it.] is a leisurely round trip, and we were a bit too early to catch fall foliage, but it still ended up being a lot of fun.

After the train we stayed a few more hours in the town, grabbing lunch and stopping in some of our favorite shops.
