A quiet holiday hosted by my parents in Stephenson, VA. My brother and his family made the drive from Maryland, and we drove down with our cat, Cora (who proved to be a good traveler, if a little too interested in jumping on the dashboard to see out the windshield).

I believe I tried out [Eddy’s Point and Shoot film sim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcwRgK7CX2U) for these but I think they’re a little too contrasty and I don’t like how brown skin gets rendered.
