The holidays were quiet; due to Covid-19 we elected not to visit family. Instead we celebrated at home, and scheduled an outdoor meeting at [Wildwood Lake](https://www.wildwoodlake.org) in Harrisburg, PA—which is roughly at the halfway point between our home and Jordan’s parents’. We took a walk around the lake, exchanged gifts, and drove back home.

The portion of the [Pennsylvania Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Canal) along the west side of the lake had partly frozen over, leading to some interesting patterns in the ice.
