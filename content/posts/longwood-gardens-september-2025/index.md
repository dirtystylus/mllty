Had a few complimentary tickets to Longwood Gardens (dating back to my Bluecadet days) and before they expired we decided to pay a visit.

We went up one of the handful of treehouses, and took a walk through the big meadow, a place I had not seen in past visits.

The Bonsai Courtyard is relatively new, but a big treat for Em, who is quite fascinated by the art.
