This came out before [*The Late Americans*](/reading/the-late-americans/) but I read that first? Either way, the setting feels familiar, as do some of the characters (dancers, academics, neither quite achieving their professional or romantic aims). Sad people grasping for glimmers of hope (complimentary).
