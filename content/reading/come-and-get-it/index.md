Like *Such a Fun Age*, Kiley Reid builds a multi-character story that examines how little misunderstandings and misinterpretations build to larger conflict. I think she’s particularly interested in how people make ethical concessions when faced with things they really want. I wouldn’t say this was a fun read — at times I scanned ahead because I was fille with so much dread. I wish that the sadness was offset by a little more humor.
