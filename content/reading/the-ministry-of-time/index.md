A time-travel romance that reminded me of some of my favorite books/films: I thought of *The Peripheral* and *Looper*, but especially Connie Willis’ Oxford Time Travel series (I read [*Blackout*](/reading/blackout) and [*All Clear*](/reading/all-clear) in 2022, but my favorite is *To Say Nothing of the Dog*).

There’s a lot going on plot-wise in this book, but that’s all quite secondary to me—Kaliane Bradley writes beautifully, and I probably highlighted more of this book than any other in recent memory.
