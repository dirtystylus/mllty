What an absolutely metal title, referencing William Blake’s *The Proverbs of Hell*. I started this on the beach during vacation via my Kindle, and finished it on paperback at home. It reminded me at times of Elizabeth Hand’s Cass Neary books, and David Fincher’s adaptation of *The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo*.
