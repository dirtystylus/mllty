This was written by a former professor of mine whose classes I very much enjoyed, so itâ€™s a little hard to be objective about it. That said: I thought that this was an incredible read, a coming-of-age story set partly in 1970s Korea but reaching into past during the Korean War. Myth collides with memory, and some of the later chapters floored me as the past comes to haunt the present day.
