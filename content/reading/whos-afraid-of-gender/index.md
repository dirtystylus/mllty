I read this slowly over the course of a month. Some of that is because I kept getting angry—pretty much all the things that Butler warns about have escalated with the incoming government, especially anti-trans executive orders. The other factor was the language—it’s quite dry, and sometimes refers to theory that I’m not familiar with. So: a tough one on a couple of fronts, but I’m glad that I kept reading.
