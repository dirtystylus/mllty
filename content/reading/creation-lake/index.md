More formally constructed than I expected—Sadie Smith’s intelligence activities in the French countryside are interspersed with the text of hacked emails from Bruno Lacombe, an aging activist whose historical missives gradually worm their way into Sadie’s consciousness. It’s nominally a spy thriller, but also: Sadie is a freelance narc, so YMMV in terms of your investment in her as a central character.
