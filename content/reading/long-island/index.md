I was a couple of chapters in before I clocked that this was a sequel to *Brooklyn*.^[I have seen the movie adaptation of that book, but have not read the book itself] What a slow-motion tragedy for the three central characters (Eilis, Jim, and Karen). Wounded people bringing so much harm through silence and inaction. I thought a lot about Edith Wharton: [*The House of Mirth*](/reading/house-of-mirth/), sure, but especially Scorcese’s adaptation of *The Age of Innocence*. Just a classic case of me tearing through a story, knowing full well that only pain awaits.
