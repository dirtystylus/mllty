Covid-era fiction — I was tempted to eject but stuck through through it. This book is wrestling with class, colonialism, environmental destruction, and the recent pandemic…and it didn’t always successfully balance all of those big themes. It felt a bit caught between a bigger, more expansive version, and a smaller, more focused one.
