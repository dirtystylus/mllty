Another Ana and Din mystery. I suspect that Robert Jackson Bennett is using a stew of familiar genre tropes (giant monsters threatening the realm, genetically-enhanced humans, wealth and corruption) to ultimately tell a story about colonialism and the rot at the heart of an empire. But I also worry that Bennett might not be quite up to that task? Either way I’m enjoying the mysteries and the way Bennett doesn’t overexplain the world, instead trusting us to infer meaning from context.
