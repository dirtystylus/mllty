[Mandy Brown](https://aworkinglibrary.com/reading/everything-for-everyone) recommended this and it took a while for my local bookshop to find me a copy, but I’m so glad I have it in my hands. It’s set in a future where a global societal collapse sparks a revolution that gives birth to communes worldwide—bringing peace, meaningful work, universal health care, housing, and food to everyone. The characters who are the subject of each chapter in the oral history recount the struggle to form a better world after the violent death of the old one.

If at times it reads like a leftist wish list, it also serves as a sobering reminder that we could have all those things *now*, but it will take hard work and collective action to make them a reality.
