I read this before rewatching *The Worst Person in the World* — two coming-of-age stories about women searching for direction. I felt that the music industry stuff felt more lived-in that in [*Utopia Avenue*](/reading/utopia-avenue). I want a playlist of all the songs Riggs lists throughout the book.
