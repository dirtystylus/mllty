I am a huge fan of Nicola Griffith’s *Hild* series ([*Menewood*](/reading/menewood/) the latest massive volume) and I was glad when friends alerted me to the reprinting of her Aud Torvingen series. Lots of the same thematic preoccupations as her *Hild* books: what does it take to build a haven in a violent world? What would you do to keep the people you loved safe? I thought of Liz Hand’s Cass Neary novels and films like *Le Samouraï*, *The American*, and (to a lesser extent) *Atomic Blonde*. After finishing it I immediately ordered the other two books in the series.
