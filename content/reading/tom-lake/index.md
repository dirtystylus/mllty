With her three daughters sequestered on the family farm during the Covid-19 pandemic, Lara recounts her long-ago romance with a Hollywood star. A coming of age novel where the overriding tone is wistfulness, not tragedy and regret. A fine enough read in my current moment of trying to rebuild my reading muscles.
