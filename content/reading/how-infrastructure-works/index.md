I had been super-excited for this book, pre-ordered it, and then it languished in my TBR pile for a year. But perhaps now was the right moment to absorb it, in a political landscape that will likely see increased deregulation, new investments in non-renewable energy, and overall deprioritization of infrastructure.

I really had to sit with this line post-election:

> It's why good infrastructure is strongly correlated with not only access to resources, but with equitable, stable political systems.^[page 121.]

This may be the most impactful book I’ve read this year—it crystallized many loose ideas that I was familiar with—public goods, positive/negative externalities, the futility of plastics recycling—and situated them within a technological, social, and political framework. It felt like completing a mind-expanding class in college.^[This makes perfect sense, Deb Chachra is a professor at Olin College of Engineering.] According to Readwise I highlighted 67 passages in the book.^[I was reading this in hardback so that meant using the screenshot function, I was *dedicated*. The next-highest book had 12 highlights.]

There’s too many ideas swirling in my head, but I recently started a new job so I’ll focus on that. I often have to think about the balance of humans and the work that has to be done, and I really appreciated how Deb Chachra illustrated the tension between optimization and resilience:

> Making systems resilient is fundamentally at odds with optimization, because optimizing a system means taking out any slack. A truly optimized, and thus efficient, system is only possible with near-perfect knowledge about the system, together with the ability to observe and implement a response. For a system to be reliable, on the other hand, there have to be some unused resources to draw on when the unexpected happens, which, well, happens predictably.^[page 209.]

> To capitalism, sustainability always looks like underutilization.^[page 257.]

Of all the lessons that I drew from this book, the biggest one is familiar: capitalism and profit-seeking are such deficient ways to guide our investments in the systems that we all rely on. 

Reading this book I swung between fist-pumping idealism and deep despair, but ultimately I hold out hope for a global movement towards equitable, sustainable, resilient infrastructure that will serve us now and deep into the future.
