I didn’t realize this was an adaptation of *David Copperfield*, transposed to Appalachia. I haven’t read Dickens’ book, but I did recently watch [*The Personal History of David Copperfield*](https://letterboxd.com/dirtystylus/film/the-personal-history-of-david-copperfield/) so I had the characters and general shape of the plot somewhat fresh in my brain. Barbara Kingsolver uses the opiod epidemic as a force wreaking havoc in the lives of her characters and their community, connecting it to a broader history of government and corporate negligence and exploitation of Appalachia.
