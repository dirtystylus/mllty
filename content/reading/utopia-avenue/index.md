I liked this best when it was fairly grounded in the historical fiction zone, less so when it gradually revealed itself to be part of the extended *Bone Clocks* universe. I know that Mitchell has always woven his previous characters throughout his novels, but I would’ve preferred he stopped at cameo appearances, and not a deepening of the existing lore. It really felt like a novel that had its start as one idea and then Mitchell couldn’t help himself.
