It took me a long time to come back to Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad books, mostly because *In the Woods* and *The Likeness* were so bleak. This one felt more straightforward to me, plot-wise—I think maybe French was less concerned with setting up a whodunit than examining family dynamics. I still appreciate how she writes her unreliable narrators—these are men who imagine themselves the hero of the story, but at the core they do not understand themselves and their weaknesses.
