I remember this landing on a bunch of year-end best-of lists a couple of years ago, and I went in cold thinking it was a memoir about Hsu’s love affair with music. Which it is, in parts, along with Hsu’s stories of political awakening. But it’s mostly a loving tribute to his friend Ken, killed in a carjacking-turned-murder during their college years at Berkeley. I’m glad I finally picked this up off my TBR stack.
