Whew. This is a big book, and at times—especially the beginning—it reminded me of Susanna Clarke’s novels. I had a hard time tracking the tone in the final third—things that should have felt like a gut punch sometimes came and went, in a way that confused me. I sometimes appreciated the formal structure with so many characters, but occasionally felt like all those threads weren’t meshing well. Honestly not sure what to make of it.
