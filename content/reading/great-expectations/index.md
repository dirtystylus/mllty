A coming of age novel set during the presidential campaign of a candidate that is clearly Barack Obama,^[Cunningham worked on Obama’s first presidential campaign, and later in the White House.] this is a slice of autofiction that captures the hope, naïveté, and eventual disillusionment of that political moment.
