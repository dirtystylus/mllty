Had this on my TBR list and forgot how it ended up there, but I picked it up at the library and it was a perfect two-day read. Reminded me a lot of the film *Constantine*: damned souls, rogue angels, and demons. There’s magical syndicates, too, but thankfully we don’t get too deep into their bureacratic inner workings. It borrows a lot from film noir, but eschews some of the usual tropes: in most noir sex gets you killed, but the queer sex here is joyful and a refuge from a dangerous world.
