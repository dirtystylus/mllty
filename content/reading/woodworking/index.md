I’ve been a fan of Emily St. James dating back to her writing on tv and pop culture, so I was very curious to read her first novel. It’s a coming-of-age/trans awakening story that follows three women — Erica, Abigail, and Brooke — whose lives all intersect in funny and heartbreaking ways. St. James flips between narrators, and sometimes narrator point of view, in ways that highlight how closely the characters are to their true selves. I thought immediately of St. James’ comments on narrative point of view in [*Harrow the Ninth*](https://www.vox.com/culture/22227711/harrow-the-ninth-tamsyn-muir-vox-book-club-discussion-post), and I feel like this novel lets her show off that understanding of different modes. (St. James was also recently interviewed about the [narration in *Woodworking*](https://lithub.com/emily-st-james-on-using-differing-povs-to-write-a-trans-novel/).) Overall I really enjoyed it, and after struggling through some recent books I flew through this one.
