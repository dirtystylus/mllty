I’ve known Jen for a while now — we met in 2018 when I joined her [*So Now You’re a Manager* training](/posts/so-now-youre-a-manager/) in Philadelphia and she coached me after my transition to the role at Upstatement. I knew the barest outline of this story from what Jen has shared in the past, but it was inspiring and humbling to read a fuller expression of her experience. I’m excited that I get to moderate a reading and Q&A with Jen this weekend in Philly to continue her book tour.
