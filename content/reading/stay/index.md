[The Blue Place](/reading/the-blue-place) was a hard act to follow. If that series opener gave us Aud Torvingen as a calm, supremely confident killer, *Stay* begins with Aud physically and emotionally on the mend, restoring herself as she hand-builds a cabin in the woods. I see parallels to the story that Griffith would later tell in her Hild novels — a woman who loses everything gradually rebuilds her strength by saving other people.
