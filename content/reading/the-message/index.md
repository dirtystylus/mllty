A bit of an odd collection but in a good way—it felt like Coates’s more abstract meditations on the craft of writing kept getting interrupted by more urgent subjects. The first sections are fine on their own merits but are overshadowed by the last section—where Coates travels to Palestine and Israel and draws connections between Jim Crow, apartheid, and the Israeli state policy. In some ways it felt like I was rehashing a lot of what I had recently read in [The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine](/reading/hundred-years-war-palestine/) but it is notable and welcome for a writer of Coates’ stature and popularity to put his shoulder to the project of justice for Palestine.
