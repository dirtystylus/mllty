Brandon Taylor’s introduction was the draw to pick up this edition, and I was much more captivated compared to my [first time reading it](/reading/persuasion/). I’ve had the novel on my brain after watching [*The House of Mirth*](/watching/the-house-of-mirth-20260112/). Introverts deserve love, too.
