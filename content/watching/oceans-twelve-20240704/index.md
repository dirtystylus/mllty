I’ve seen _Ocean’s Eleven_ more times, but this might be my favorite of the three. There isn’t an elaborate heist here—the closest we get is an absolutely ridiculous laser-field dance sequence (I’ve always wondered if that was a wink at Catherine Zeta-Jones’ similar work in _Entrapment_). Just fun locations and a real commitment to the joke about Julia’s star persona.
