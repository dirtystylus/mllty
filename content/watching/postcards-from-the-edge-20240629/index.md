Way more singing than I expected! Streep and MacLaine just having a ball—loved the scene where they both sing and MacLaine’s Doris simply _cannot_ help herself from upstaging her daughter. Streep’s expression is hard to read in that moment—she’s clapping along with the crowd, and _seems_ delighted, but…?

Completely missed Annette Bening in one of her earliest roles (I think this came right after _The Grifters_?). I did think a little bit about _20th Century Women_ afterwards, though.

RIP Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.

(Watched as part of Criterion’s Shirley MacLaine collection.)
