Watched this at Bryn Mawr Film Institute, in a surprisingly well-attended midday screening for being three-ish weeks into release. I want to rewatch this soon — the prologue is quite different, tonally, from the rest of the movie and it left my nerves jangled and it took a while for that feeling to subside.

I don’t have a lot to say except that the performances are strong across the board, and I think there’s going to be a big awards push for much of the cast. Teyana Taylor, Regina Hall, and Benicio Del Toro really stood out on this viewing, (Leo has never been my favorite actor but I do like him in this type of comedic role.)

I am really curious how Black audiences are receiving this film, because I did have questions about how Black radicalism/femininity/sexuality &c. are portrayed, and whether the intent matches the interpretation.
