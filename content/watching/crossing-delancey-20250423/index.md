This is becoming a favorite of mine; I will have to pick up the Criterion 4K next time there’s a sale. Every Joan Micklin Silver film I’ve watched so far (_Between the Lines_, _Hester Street_ being the other two) has been great. This one makes for a good thematic pairing with _Hester Street_ — although they are set in different eras, both deal with Jewish assimilation in New York City and how different characters choose to negotiate that.
