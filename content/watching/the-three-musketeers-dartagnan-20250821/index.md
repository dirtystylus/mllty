Was curious about this, did not expect all the star power. Vicky Krieps! Eva Green! Vincent Cassel! Also I did not recognize Louis Garrel until I checked tha cast list. Louis playing King Louis XIII. 

I like that D’Artagnan is told to his face that he’s pretty, but dumb. There’s a lot of palace intrigue and swashes being buckled, but I wonder how this will come together in the sequel. It already feels overstuffed.
