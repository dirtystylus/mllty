I picked up the 4K edition of _Flow_ and this was one of the bonus features. Lots of the same things that I enjoyed with _Flow_: a mysterious opening, fun animal buddies, and very contemplative visual compositions. The animation approach hints at the more mature, team-generated work to come in _Flow_, and I’m excited to rewatch that film.
