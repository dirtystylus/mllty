Lucy Zhang’s Émelie reminded me a bit of Park Ji-min’s Freddie from _Return to Seoul_, a spiky young woman who is in the process of self-discovery. I wanted more depth in the script for Makita Samba’s Camille. Noémie Merlant’s Nora gets what is probably the most compelling and successful storyline (I read somewhere that Céline Sciamma may have written that part?), but it also felt like it didn’t quite fit in with Émelie and Camille’s overlapping stories.
