Watched this in 3D. Like the first part the color grading washes out the lovely costumes and sets, which is a shame. Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum are miscast, because they cannot sing, and in Yeoh’s case they cannot bring the campiness needed for the role. But the biggest problem with these movies is that there really only needed to be one. Breaking them up like this really underscores how the songs pale in comparison to the first movie (a problem shared by the musical). But it also breaks up the narrative momentum which would have carried you through the whole story, and you start wondering about each character’s motivations, and then you realize that huge parts of this don’t make any sense at all, except in connection to _The Wizard of Oz_ — except! — the retconning of the plot undermines that very story, so what are we even doing here? What are we supposed to feel, in the end? That we should accept people different from us, except they need to live in exile so a white avatar can experience personal growth? And the animals should be allowed to form a teacher’s union? It’s just a mess, y’all.
