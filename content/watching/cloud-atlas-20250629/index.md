Love to see multiple _Paddington 2_ alums in the cast! Ben Wishaw’s voice is a cheat code for accessing deep emotional beats in a story. I thought a lot about his performance in _Bright Star_.

Surprised by how much this worked for me…I had heard that it was a big mess but I followed along the overlapping threads without much confusion (I read the book a long time ago so that probably helped, even if I remember very few details about the plot/characters). I found it a lot more visually coherent than _Jupiter Ascending_ during the action scenes. No bees, though.

I would definitely like to read some analysis on the race-bent casting in the neo-Seoul segments, because I can see why it makes sense given the story’s themes, but in practice it’s jarring.

Made me want to rewatch _Gattaca_ for multiple reasons — the themes, for sure, but also the score.
