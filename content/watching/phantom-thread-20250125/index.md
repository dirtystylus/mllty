Gets funnier and funnier every time I rewatch it. DDL’s childish, whiny delivery. Lesley Manville’s stone-cold affect. The sounds of breakfast. Vicky Krieps aggressively pouring water for tea.

In love with the look of this—I reluctantly admit that I will have to upgrade to the 4K disc at some point.
