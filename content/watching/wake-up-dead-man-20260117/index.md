Watched this in three sittings over three weeks — probably not an ideal way to encounter it. Wish the story made better use of this stacked cast, but I guess everyone is having fun, Glenn Close especially. Looks better than most Netflix productions, and I wish I had caught it in the theater during its short run. We are never getting these Netflix installments on disc, are we?
