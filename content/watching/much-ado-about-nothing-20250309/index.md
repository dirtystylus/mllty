Shakespeare loves:

* A callow, suggestible romantic lead (Claudio, the worst)  
* A fake death

A stacked cast and everyone seems game, even if Emma Thompson has more chemistry in one scene with Denzel than she does the whole movie with Branagh. Which is funny to think about, considering Thompson was married to Branagh at the time.

Michael Keaton is acting in a completely different movie but his horseless galloping is one of the few things I remembered from the first time I saw this.
