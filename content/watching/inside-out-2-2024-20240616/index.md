A fine way to spend a scorching-hot Sunday with the kids. I like the continued depiction of hockey, even if it doesn’t quite capture the chaos of the game. (Whenever a team is shown huddling to draw up a play and then execute it…well, it’s the Mighty Ducks’ Flying V all over again.) My girls and I laughed at the obvious references to Dora and Final Fantasy VII. I worry that since this made a truckload of cash Disney will feel validated in their [“clear mass appeal” strategy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-05-30/disney-s-inside-out-2-could-hold-key-to-pixar-restoring-movie-magic).
