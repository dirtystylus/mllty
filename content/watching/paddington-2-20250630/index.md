_This review may contain spoilers._

This finally got a 4K disc release in the US. Still the best one in the series, and it’s hard to see anything topping this. The way it deals with big topics like immigration and prisons is just as much a magic trick as the pop-up book animation sequence: the movie’s making a point, but it’s also nicely calibrated to the fun. I really felt the Mission Impossible vibes in the final action sequence, and I wonder if the filmmakers have explicitly cited those films as an influence.

Inspired casting across the board but Hugh Grant steals the show, and I’m glad the disc contained the full-res credits scene as an extra.
