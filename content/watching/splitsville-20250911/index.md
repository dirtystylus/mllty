A remarriage comedy, and it leans into absurdist screwball territory (very enjoyable for someone like me who loves that era of film). Very funny, and like _Hundreds of Beavers_ contains some truly great (and unexpected) fight choreography. I read somewhere that Covino/Marvin used to direct commercials and you can see some of that pop up in a couple of showy sequences.

My eldest has been getting into ceramics so I enjoyed the pottery scenes. Iâ€™m here for the raku.
