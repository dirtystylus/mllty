I’m paraphrasing messages to my movie group chat here, but: a horny, pagan _Local Hero_ mixed with Fincher’s _Dragon Tattoo_ and Liz Hand’s Cass Neary novels. Also: a horror-laced bizarro-world version of _The 40-Year-Old Virgin_. Creepiness counterbalanced by the silliness. I laughed early on as Sergeant Howie got into a series of tiny cars and tiny planes.

So many weird choices. The music is especially baffling!
