Enjoyable but also felt choppy—the musical numbers feel crafted for existing fans of the musical, with so many visual bits breaking up the songs’ flow. Made me think about how the first two Harry Potter films feel so burdened by fidelity to the books.

On the way out my youngest pointed out how the look was low-contrast and there was so much backlighting, and I agree. The muddy look doesn’t do the costumes justice, which is a shame.

Anyway…fun, but didn’t linger in my mind visually or emotionally.
