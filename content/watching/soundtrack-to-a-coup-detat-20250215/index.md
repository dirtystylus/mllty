Too many layers of history and politics to do this justice, so instead a few moments of absurdity that stuck with me:

* A zoomed-in shot of a UN delegate picking his nose  
* A telegram saying, essentially, “Too many assassins on the ground, don’t send any more”  
* Khrushchev pounding tables, lecterns, anything really
