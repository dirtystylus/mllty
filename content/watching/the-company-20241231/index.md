This one has bounced around my watchlist for a very long time, always hovering in that purgatorial dead zone that _almost_ gets watched. I appreciated how it focused on the everyday scenes of practice and collaboration, with only the slightest overlay of plot to help things along—it’s telling that the weakest parts for me were the middle sections where Neve Campbell’s Ry starts a relationship with James Franco’s Josh. There’s no overly dramatic climax in the end—just a glimpse at the hard work of the company to put on a technically demanding ballet. Costume changes, injuries big and small, creative friction—all bubbling under the sublime moments onstage.
