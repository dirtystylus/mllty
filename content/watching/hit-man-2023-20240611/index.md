Tried to catch this in the theater but missed it. Somehow didn’t realize that Adria Arjona played Bix in _Andor_. I liked Glen Powell in this role but imagine if Ryan Gosling were in this?

Anyway, this completed my viewing of Netflix’s hitman comedy duology, (_The Killer_ being the other one). If _The Killer_’s meta theme is about directing, this one is all about acting.
