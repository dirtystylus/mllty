I’m in the middle of re-reading _Persuasion_, and I’d never seen any of the adaptations, so I started with this one. Stays very close to the text, in ways that made me appreciate how well Austen’s novel translates to the screen on a scene-by-scene basis. Loved seeing some familiar faces: Ciarán Hinds, Fiona Shaw, Sophie Thompson (who was in _Emma_ just one year later).
