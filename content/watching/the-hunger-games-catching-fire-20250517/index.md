I suspect my daughter is into these movies even as she casually roasts them. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Donald Sutherland sharing scenes — a layer of real loss on top of the fictional losses that mount in this second installment. Looks a lot better than the first one — less shaky cam, the CGI doesn’t look as cheap, and the multi-generational competitors in the Quarter Quell are full of serious actors who make things feel less silly by embracing the silliness.
