Lots to like in this Canadian indie, and I saw maybe a little too much of myself in Isaiah Lehtinen’s Lawrence. I recognized some faces (Andy McQueen from _Mrs. Davis_, Percy Hynes White from _My Old Ass_).

I thought this was a workplace comedy going in and it does have some elements of that, but it’s more of a coming of age film that doesn’t shy away from some particularly dark themes. The final act might feel a bit too tidy but I appreciated the hopeful tone. Reminded me a bit of Cooper Raiff’s _Shithouse_.
