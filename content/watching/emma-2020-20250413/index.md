Part two of my Austen watch after _Love & Friendship_. I remember liking this ok when I saw it during the pandemic, but absolutely fell in love with it this time. Just a feat of visual compositionâ€”the costuming, the production design, the cinematography. I screencapped so many frames and captured so many GIFs, like Tumblr was back in style.
