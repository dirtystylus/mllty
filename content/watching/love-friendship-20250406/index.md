Watched this as part one of an Austen adaptation double bill with _Emma. (2020)_. The first time I saw this I found Tom Bennett’s Sir James Martin amusing but annoying. This time through I found the performance hilarious. Whit Stillman has made many a film influenced by Austen, it’s refreshing to see him so attuned to her cutting wit and gift for social satire.
