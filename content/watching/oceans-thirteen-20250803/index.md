Finally finished rewatching the trilogy after its rerelease on 4K discs. Not quite up to the level of the first two, mostly because it’s too long, and the revenge storyline means Elliott Gould is on the sideline for most of the movie. It also misses the feminine energy that Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones brought to the first two installments. I enjoyed the labor rights angle, even if it’s played for laughs.
