I enjoyed this a lot, even if I can see the merit of [Frank Falisi’s critque](https://letterboxd.com/frankfalisi/film/perfect-days-2023/) on the romanticization of Hirayama’s labor. Koji Yakusho is almost wordless in the early going, yet so expressive in gesture and expression. The final scene hints at a big change in Hirayama’s life, but I could easily see another cut to a dream sequence ended by the sounds of sweeping outside his window and another start to the same routine, which is its own quiet form of heartbreak.
