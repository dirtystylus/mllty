Was very curious about this one, ever since it got a Criterion release a few years ago. Really wished Willie Best’s Algernon hadn’t been characterized in such a racist manner by the filmmakers.

This was my first time watching an Ida Lupino film, I am excited to see more.

I thought a lot about _Heat_ while watching this, trying to figure out who was the Waingro of the crew. That “one last job” setup for stories really has endured over the years!

(Watched as part of Criterion’s Ida Lupino collection.)
