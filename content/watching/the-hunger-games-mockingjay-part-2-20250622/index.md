Throughout watching these movies I kept thinking about how this story —  which has a few things to say about fascism, revolution/terrorism, propaganda, and corruption — chooses to make it palatable with a predominantly white cast of heroes. I wonder how many US fans ever made the connection that we aren’t the oppressed districts, we’re the Capitol?
