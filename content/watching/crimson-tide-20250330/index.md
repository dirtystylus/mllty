The Tarantino touch stood out (derogatory) but Denzel and Gene Hackman (RIP) make a good meal out of it anyway. I thought a lot about sweat continuity, particularly for Rivetti and the sonar boys. What a cast! Classic “that guy” Matt Craven, Gandolfini, Viggo (shockingly young and beautiful).

There’s a moment before they get on the sub where Denzel says goodbye to his wife by pressing his fingers to the car window and saying, “I’ll see you in my dreams” and it’s not _not_ a call-forward to _Déjà Vu_.
