Missed this when it played for a few weeks at Bryn Mawr Film Institute, glad to finally catch it. Was distracted by a musical motif that is a close cousin to _Yumeji’s Theme_ (the musical backbone of _In the Mood for Love_). Camille Rutherford plays Agathe, a struggling writer who would be a spinster aunt character in one of Austen’s books. As expected there’s a love triangle, but I like that director Laura Piani keeps bringing the focus back to Agathe’s writing.
