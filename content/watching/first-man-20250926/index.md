\[metal creaks stressfully\]

The opening is basically _Top Gun: Maverick_ but super, super scary, and if there’s one thing thing that worked for me with _First Man_ it’s that I really felt like these astronauts were in constant danger. Visor tip to the foley artists on this one. Gosling does great work here but I have to say having recently rewatched _The Nice Guys_: I really prefer Gosling in goofy mode to super-serious actor mode.

Hard not to conflate real history with _For All Mankind_’s fake history, and wonder when Margo Madison was going to show up.
