Really fun, and I was quite impressed with the visual storytelling here. Sometimes these older movies can feel a little cheesy with the rear projection and other obvious effects, but there are shots here that made me feel like Hitchcock was really fired up. Maybe it was the urgency of the Second World War — the film is an explicit plea for the United States to enter the war, with some scenes employing a direct-to-camera (and therefore audience) appeal.
