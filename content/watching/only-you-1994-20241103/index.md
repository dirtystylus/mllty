This particular rom-com outline really got a workout in the early 90s, you could just roll this back-to-back with _Sleepless in Seattle_: quirky heroine engaged to boring man seeks a more destiny-inflected romance.

I know Bonnie Hunt mostly does voice work these days but I miss seeing her onscreen. Her character is let down by the script, though.

Feel validated reading that Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey, Jr. were dating at the timeâ€”when their characters first kiss I thought, that looks like more than a stage kiss.
