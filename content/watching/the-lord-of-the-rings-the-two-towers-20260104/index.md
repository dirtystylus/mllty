Extended edition, with S. This middle chapter has a lot of heavy plot place-setting to do, but once we hit Rohan I feel like everything hits its stride (pun intended). Bernard Hill as Theoden is my stealth MVP for the series — the way he rediscovers his courage, power, and honor in the face of overwhelming odds is always affecting. Watching the Eowyn/Aragorn scenes this time I was reminded that she so young and naive compared to Aragorn, who is many decades older than her.

In a fun coincidence, I just started watching _The Pitt_, which stars Fiona Dourif, child of Brad Dourif (Grima).
