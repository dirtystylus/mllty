First-time watch for my youngest, who noted how many things have been cribbed from this story by other books/movies. I grew up with the books and these movies, but it has been quite a while since I watched them. Still feels like a miracle of craft: from the script to the cast to the way it’s shot and edited.

When Boromir says “my brother/my captain/my king” to Aragorn I cried, as I always do.
