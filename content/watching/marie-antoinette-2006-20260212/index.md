Listing this as a first-time watch because if I’d seen it before I remembered very little, save for moments that showed up in the trailer. So stylish — I think Sofia Coppola doesn’t get enough credit for how effortlessly she constructs a mood, a feeling, from visuals and music. You can see her influence on period pieces set to modern musical needle drops, except they often feel ham-fisted in comparison.
