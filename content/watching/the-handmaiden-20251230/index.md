Meant to watch this alongside _Bound_ several months ago, as part of a “Be Gay, Do Crime” double-header. Finally ordered a copy of the Curzon import disc, which has both theatrical and extended versions. I stuck to the theatrical this time, (which is [apparently what Park Chan-wook prefers](https://collider.com/park-chan-wook-handmaiden-extended-edition-interview/)).

I feel like Park (like Brian De Palma) is often concerned with what _isn’t_ shown by the camera, and the formal structure here is deployed to show you the subjectivity of the camera’s gaze. It’s a nice way of showing interiority via overlapping perspectives.

Having recently read the source material _Fingersmith_ I noticed that the writers decided not to include one of the larger plot threads (a decision that I agree with, since it is quite convoluted and stretches credulity). I do think having the source material helped Park stick the landing, whereas the ending of a film like _Decision to Leave_ felt messy (but in the best way).
