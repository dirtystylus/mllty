Rod Steiger literally chewing the scenery when his Chief Gillespie is introduced. So much rage bubbling under the surface of Poitier’s Detective Virgil Tibbs, topped with that honey-voiced delivery. The scene in the greenhouse where that rage uncoils is almost too fast to see, but unmistakeable in impact. Breathtaking.

Not sure about the final scene—is it saying their common bond as cops transcends all the horrifying violence and racism Tibbs has just witnessed and experienced? I hope not, but it does seem to be giving the audience and easy way out.
