Watched this over several nights with the kids—their entry into musicals has been through Lin-Manuel Miranda’s _Hamilton_ and _In the Heights_, so it’s been fun introducing them to earlier musicals that clearly influenced Miranda and his collaborators.

I had mostly forgotten the details of this adaptation, it’s hard to believe it’s already twenty years old. It might feel even more urgent now, in a moment where our queer communities are once again under increasing threat.
