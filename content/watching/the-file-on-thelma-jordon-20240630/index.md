A bit bound by the conventions of classic noir, especially in the moralistic endingâ€”I think a more modern take on this would probably go all-in on the manipulative cynicism, ending up somewhere in the vicinity of _Body Heat_. Stanwyck is a magnetic screen presence, always fun to watch her wrap hapless men around her finger.
