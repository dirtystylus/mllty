Introduced the kids to this. They loved the costumes, and S kept saying “I can see what’s happening!” which is a tribute to the gaffers and best boys on the lighting crew. I know that this was shot on digital but it really does show a level of care…it _feels_ like film. The kids also loved Mia Goth as Harriet, with her silly walk. They had many questions about class structures and etiquette during the Regency era.

Afterwards I got to show them that Autumn de Wilde directed videos for their beloved Florence + the Machine.
