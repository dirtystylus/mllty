This came out in 2015 but is so 90s in so many ways, can’t believe the Wachowskis were basically like, what if a movie about rollerblading…in the air?

This is _soooo_ many movies in one:

\* A Cinderella story  
\* A remix of _The Matrix_  
\* A rom-com about meeting a wolf-man from the wrong side of the tracks  
\* A bureaucratic comedy  
\* A psychosexual drama about wanting to fuck your mom  
\* A dystopian drama about capitalism’s final boss form and what happens when you let billionaires colonize space  
\* A mecha anime  
\* A Bee Movie™

I feel like the Wachowskis’ action sequences work better at a closer scale — I miss the legibility of the first two Matrix movies — it seems like the larger the canvas and the more things are onscreen, the harder it was for my eyes to follow.

Wild that Eddie Redmayne did _that voice_ and the Wachowskis were like, yes, more of that please
