Watched this during a thematically-appropriate blackout brought on by heavy winds in our neighborhood. We hooked up my portable Blu-ray player to my laptop, validating my dedication to physical media. My kids have loved the musical OST since they were little, and they have some quibbles about changes in this adaptation, but overall this is reliable family fun.
