Continuing the trilogy with my youngest. She is continually impressed at how Legolas goes through an entire battle with barely a smudge or a scratch on him. She is also keeping a running count of female characters in this saga and it’s not a good look, Tolkien. We had to rewind the Theoden transformation because it is still so magical — the reverse of a horror effect.
