Fun to go from seeing Carey Mulligan at the start of her film career (in _Pride & Prejudice_) to this, on consecutive days. The tonal balance on this one is tricky, and I don’t think that they always nailed it, but ultimately I enjoyed this. It’s much more about grief and regret than anything else, despite the very comedic setup. I was reminded a lot of _Juliet, Naked_.
