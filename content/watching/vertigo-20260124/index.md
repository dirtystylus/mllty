I have owned the 4K disc for a while now, but I finally popped it in and it looks amazing. A funny feeling rewatching the film that has inspired so much copying and homage, and I’m already planning a rewatch of _Vertigo_ riffs like _Phoenix_ and _Decision to Leave_.

 Hitchcock and his obsessions are barely hidden by story/character, it’s basically all text. This time through I really focused on Kim Novak’s characters, and I highly recommend [this essay by Laurent Wilford on Bright Wall/Dark Room](https://www.brightwalldarkroom.com/2016/04/19/possessed/). “_Vertigo_ is a film about fake female madness and real male madness.” is such a killer line.
