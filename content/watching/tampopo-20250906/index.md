Fun, and not at all what I thought it was going to be. I imagined something more like _Ramen Heads_.

My movie club paired this with _Venom_, which sounds like chaos but there were some points of resonance — the eroticism of hunger, in particular. Also the kiss in _Venom_ is not unlike the egg yolk scene in _Tampopo_, I will not be explaining further.
