I missed the boat on Umbrella’s 4K disc release (it’s going for over $250 on auction sites these days) but rented it via [Scarecrow Video](https://scarecrowvideo.org/rent-by-mail). It looks eye-popping good, and I fell in love once again with Eiko Ishioka’s costume designs and Tarsem’s sense of composition and transition. Even if the final third can’t quite bear the weight of Alexandria and Roy’s individual pain, it’s still a film I enjoy revisiting every few years for the visual wonder alone.
