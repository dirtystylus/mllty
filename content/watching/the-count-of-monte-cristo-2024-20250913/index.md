I enjoyed this more than the recent Three Musketeers duology that I watched recently. Reminded me a bit of the _Lupin_ series on Netflix. It’s pretty long, but I almost wanted it to be slightly longer — once the revenge plots get underway they are exciting and sweet, and it feels like the movie could have given a little more space to how the desire for revenge starts to corrode Dantès, Haydée, and Andrea. Never having read the book, the ending felt a bit ambiguous to me, but in a good way?
