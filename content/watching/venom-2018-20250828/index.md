That was definitely…something, alright. I can’t believe that this got made (complimentary). I have no clue why most of this cast signed on to this, but it was good to see Michelle Williams and Jenny Slate after seeing them together in _Dying for Sex_.

Hardy’s Venom voice is a cross between Cookie Monster and Ana Faris as Shelley in _The House Bunny_, truly an inspired choice.
