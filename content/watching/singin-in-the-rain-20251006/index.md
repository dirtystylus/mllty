The iconic titular sequence isn’t the one I think of first, it’s always Make ’Em Laugh or Good Mornin’, but especially the Cyd Charisse parts of Broadway Melody. Did I go into a YouTube fugue state afterwards mainlining Cyd Charisse dance sequences? Perhaps.

On this rewatch I felt like Lina and Kathy should have teamed up to carve out their own production deal at the studio.

Damien Chazelle really loved this so much he remade it twice, huh?
