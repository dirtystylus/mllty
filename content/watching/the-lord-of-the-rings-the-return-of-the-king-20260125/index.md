Extended edition with S. If I’ve seen this version before I remembered very little of the extra material. Always astounded by how well these hold up — you can see some of the seams with the visual effects, but the emotional beats still ring true.

(I borrowed the Blu-ray set from my brother to watch these, I’m trying to figure out whether I should finally get the 4K versions.)
