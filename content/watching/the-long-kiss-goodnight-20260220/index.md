Wish I could’ve seen this in a different director’s hands, but this is what we got. Shane Black + Christmas, Samuel L. Jackson feasting on the script, Geena Davis in a role that should have kept her a superstar. I thought about [_Salt_](https://letterboxd.com/film/salt-2010/), _Alias_, and the many versions of _Nikita_. I miss this era, when we had a rich array of woman-fronted action projects.
