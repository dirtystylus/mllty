Messy but enjoyable—I feel like it’s a lot stronger in the beginning. The back half didn’t quite build up the tension/release effectively, though it did feature some spectacular body-horror gross-out scenes (CW if that’s not your thing). Rose Glass still a director I’ll always pay attention to.

Kristen Stewart doing great work as the jumpiest, jitteriest person who decides _now_ is a good time to go into nicotine withdrawal. Can’t wait to see what Katy O’Brian gets to do in the next Mission Impossible. Also: Vinnie from _Dickinson_!

The ending made me think about Linklater’s _Hit Man_, again.
