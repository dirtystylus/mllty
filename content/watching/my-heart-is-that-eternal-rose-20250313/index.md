Romance/action/tragedy, and it works. Patrick Tam and Christopher Doyle really nail the neon-soaked style, although it’s a bit uneven and I feel like Doyle’s later collaborations with Wong Kar-Wai show a bit more consistency in terms of visual sophistication.

I like that Rick doesn’t exaggerate when Cheung (a baby-faced Tony Leung) asks if the Philippines is teeming with hitmen.
