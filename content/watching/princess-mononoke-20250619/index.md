I had not seen this since its theatrical release. I forgot how violent it is — decapitations, severed limbs. Lady Eboshi: a real problematic hottie. I love that this movie continually injects nuance and complication into the human/nature conflict.

Watched this with S during a power outage with a portable Blu-ray player hooked up to my laptop, physical media forever.
