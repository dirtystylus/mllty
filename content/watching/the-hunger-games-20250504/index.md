Watched this with my kid, who had just finished reading the trilogy and the prequels. So much shaky cam, the mid-00s really leaving a mark here. Mostly thought about how the _Twilight_ saga gave us two leads who ended up as stars _and_ risk-taking actors, and here…well, Jennifer Lawrence is certainly a star, and I’m hoping she gets some good projects and puts together another run like the one she was on here.
