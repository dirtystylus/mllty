It’s been a while since I’ve seen this…I wish we had gotten a half-dozen of these, and can’t figure out why we didn’t? (A friend in my movie club pointed out that this came out the same year as the first _Pirates of the Caribbean_ film, and it might be as simple as: only one boat franchise allowed at any given time).

I enjoyed the rhythm of this movie: scrambling on the deck, cannons firing, then time for a string duet. More cannons, then David Attenborough time on the Galapagos islands. Etc., etc.

Weevils joke still pundefeated.
