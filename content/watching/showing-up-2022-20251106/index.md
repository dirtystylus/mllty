I enjoyed this a lot, to the point where I actively wished I had just rented the disc instead of watching it on Tubi’s terrible video stream. Might make me finally go back and work through Kelly Reichardt’s filmography. The cast is excellent—Michelle Williams makes for a great grump, and Hong Chau is that one charismatic friend who is luckier than you, and perhaps a little bit careless with your friendship as a result. Nice to see André Benjamin/3000 as well, and you get some of his flute music in the score. Great bird acting.
