I’ve seen this before, but having just recently rewatched _When Harry Met Sally_ I was noticing how many of Meg Ryan’s expressions would flash across Jack Quaid’s face.

This is Maya Erskine’s movie, though, and as Alice she brings such great comedic timing but also believable emotion when things fall apart. It makes the final third lag a little bit because she’s offscreen and the movie follows Jack Quaid’s Ben. I enjoy the movie but I imagine if I saw the dailies and what she was bringing, I would stop shooting and re-write around her as the main character.
