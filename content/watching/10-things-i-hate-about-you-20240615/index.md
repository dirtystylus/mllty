J and the kids had never seen this so we fired it up. So very 90s to have an actual band (Letters to Cleo) integrated into the story like this. Also very 90s: very little queerness, even at the edges (maybe a little bit at the rock club).

I like that they had to explain Heath Ledgerâ€™s Aussie accent. Stadium serenade scene still kills.
