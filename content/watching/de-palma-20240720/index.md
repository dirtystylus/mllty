Wish this went a bit deeper than “De Palma reminisces for a minute about each of his films”. You get the occasional acid commentary on people he didn’t enjoy working with, and he’s pretty vocal about which of his films didn’t quite work, but on the whole I wanted just a bit more—I would have loved to hear from some other people about De Palma’s process, or his influence.

I’ve always appreciated De Palma’s eye, his romantic fatalism, and how his films often contain a critique of the Hollywood system and/or government. He makes a claim that nobody has taken up the mantle of pure visual storytelling from Hitchcock and him, which at first sounds pretty egotistical…but I’m having trouble thinking of a contemporary director who fits that mold. Park Chan-wook, maybe?
