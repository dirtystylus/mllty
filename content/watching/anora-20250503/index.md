Entertaining and funny but exhausting. I felt the runtime, even with watching it over two nights. I can’t tell if Ani is underwritten or if we’re given all we need to know — Mikey Madison certainly convinces me that Ani is the type of person who knows better but can’t help hoping she got lucky. And when things turn I think she holds on to that hope because what else is there? Pride, if nothing else — having to go back to Headquarters and deal with Diamond would certainly make me play my hand as far as it would take me. Vanya is in the pantheon of all-time mama’s boys. My mind flashed to Charles Grodin in _The Heartbreak Kid_, and I briefly wondered what this would have looked like if Elaine May had written it.
