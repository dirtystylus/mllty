So, so bleak…there are no heroes in the post-war moment depicted, and even love and friendship are corroded by the chaos and blurry moral lines. Beautiful to behold — when did we stop lighting for shadows? What a lost art. The score is so baffling and counter to my expectations about what film noir should sound like, but it…works? It certainly adds a layer of discomfort and dislocation for the viewer, which helps somewhat given what the characters are experiencing. That final shot carries a lot of weight, and made me feel like this would have been a more interesting story if it were centered on Anna.
