Had never seen this in full, only bits and pieces. Doesn’t interrogate the gender politics of its setting all that well—Sandy’s transformation at the end undercuts whatever personal growth Danny should have experienced. Some fun dream-sequence musical numbers. Wondered how much of this gets tamped down for high school musical performances.
