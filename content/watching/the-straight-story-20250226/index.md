Watched this over several days, which actually worked well given Alvin Straight’s slow progress across the American landscape. There’s an overall feeling of kindness and hopefulness throughout the movie, which is surprising because there’s so much grief and loss under the surface. Each stop/interlude reveals more about Alvin’s history, and his trip to visit his ailing brother takes on more weight as a redemptive journey for past failings. Excellent score, especially when coupled to swooping helicopter shots above fields of grain and corn.
