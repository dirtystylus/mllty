As with many of the recent Anderson films this was beautifully constructed and well-acted, but left me a little cold. I laughed a lot but didn’t feel too much emotional pull. I tend to locate that on successive watches, however — Anderson’s movies can be so dense that I am often overwhelmed by the production craft on first watch.
