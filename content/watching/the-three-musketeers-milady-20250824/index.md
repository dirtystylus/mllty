A big mess after an exciting opening installment. War stuff much less interesting than the political intrigue. Lots of location-hopping but it really diffuses the momentum instead of building it. Milady is supposed to be a big focus given the title, but we really donâ€™t get enough of her to understand her character and her real motivations.
