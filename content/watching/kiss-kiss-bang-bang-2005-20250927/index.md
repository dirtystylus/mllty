Felt like a necessary rewatch after _The Nice Guys_. Not as successful as that movie, although it is great to see Val Kilmer (RIP) playing the straight man here to RDJ’s chaotic Harry. Many (most?) of the gay jokes have curdled, even if the movie wants you to think that it’s making fun of homophobia. Was momentarily distracted because I couldn’t tell if one of the scenes was set at the building where they steal the pinch in _Oceans Eleven_. Nice to see the artwork of the late Robert McGinnis for those pulp detective novel covers — I recently picked up his monograph and he really defined the whole look of the pulpy noir novel.
