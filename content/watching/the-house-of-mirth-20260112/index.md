Watched the new BFI Blu-ray release. It looks…ok, but I can’t help feeling like it could have looked better?

I read the novel four years ago but I found this adaptation even more affecting. I felt more of the slow strangulation of Lily Bart’s social status as Bertha Dorset and others freeze her out. Viewed this over two nights because I needed a break midway, the sadness of what was to come felt overwhelming.

I wrote to my movie club:

_The House of Mirth_ has always struck me as the bleak cousin of Austen’s _Persuasion_.

Both are about hotties who may have overplayed their hands, but If _Persuasion_’s Anne Elliot is reunited with her true love at the end, _Mirth_ is like, nah, make it tragedy.
