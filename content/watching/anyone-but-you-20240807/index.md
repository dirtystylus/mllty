My biggest mistake was watching this in parts, alternating with _The Awful Truth_ starring Irene Dunne and Cary Grant. Not a fair comparison.

I don’t know, y’all—I miss the era when we would get dozens of these a year, but also…I don’t think this was very good! Going to rewatch Gluck’s own _Easy A_ instead of thinking about this any further.
