The outfits in this one are _wild_: mesh tops, monogrammed pajamas, buckle/harness pants, leather jackets for everyone. The production design feels cheap. But: there are truly transcendent sequences here full of inventive camera work paired with philosophical meanderings. If Soderbergh’s adaptation is almost exclusively about Kris Kelvin’s grief and regret, this version has more to say about humanity and the state we’ve made of our home planet.
