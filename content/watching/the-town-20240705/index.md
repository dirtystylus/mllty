First time watching the director’s cut—we get a bit more of Jon Hamm, and Blake Lively, and I think the ending feels different? I haven’t seen this since its theatrical run so I’d have to check some other time.

Owes a clear debt to _Heat_ (multiple scenes feel like a direct homage) filtered through _The Dark Knight_, with a splash of Affleck’s own _Good Will Hunting_ script. Affleck doesn’t have Michael Mann or Christopher Nolan’s command of visuals, so the pivotal scenes are exciting but not transcendent. Every crew has a jackass like Waingro, tho, huh?
