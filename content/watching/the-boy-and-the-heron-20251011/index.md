Beautiful, but also even more ambiguous and dreamlike than previous Miyazaki films. Features and incredibly abrupt coda that is a terrible experience on streaming services like HBO Max, which reduce the film to a thumbnail and push other things to watch.

There’s a recurring piano motif in Joe Hisaishi’s score that reminds me of a different piece of music, but I can’t quite make the connection and it’s driving me a little mad.

Warawara caretaker seems like a hard job but also those lil’ guys were so cute.
