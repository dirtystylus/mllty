Great food, beautiful food.

A frustrating watch because it hints at various plot threads only for those to dissipate like the steam that bathes everyoneâ€™s faces in the opening scenes. _La Binoche_ and Magimel are quite good and lend things some approximation of emotional heft, but I feel like the script lets them down. I would have preferred that it simply dwell in the transcendent moments in the cooking scenes. Also, justice for Violette, she did not deserve such condescension!
