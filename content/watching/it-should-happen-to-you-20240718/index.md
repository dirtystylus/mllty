Gladys Glover proto-influencer, without the bad grift vibes. Judy Holliday is very charming, especially when she removes her shoes to ground her intuition. I dunno about Jack Lemmon’s Pete Sheppard—he seems like a killjoy who doesn’t understand Gladys (or even want to, really).

I never really saw any Judy Holliday movies until recently. Melanie Griffith really was walking in her footsteps (TIL there was a _Born Yesterday_ remake starring Griffith).

(Watched as part of Criterion’s Columbia Screwball collection.)
