I remember liking this when it first came out. I guess a sympathetic portrayal of a principled Stasi officer felt ok when viewed from the relative safety of mid-00s politics, but it certainly hits differently now that we’re in the throes of fascist authoritarian overreach.

(Watched as part of Criterion’s Surveillance Cinema collection.)
