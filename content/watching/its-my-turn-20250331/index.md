Hadn’t seen this before — was curious because I really liked Claudia Weill’s _Girlfriends_. Does not abide by familiar romantic comedy pacing, so things feel…off, but in a good way. This came out in 1980 but you could set it in 2025 and you would sadly still be interrogating the same structural barriers to women having success in their careers and love.
