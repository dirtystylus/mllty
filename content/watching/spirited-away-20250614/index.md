I had held off watching this with the kids until they were older. I wasn’t sure what they would make of it — there are some genuinely weird and scary moments, as well as Miyazaki’s recurring themes about greed and environmental destruction. When Kamaji revealed his arms they both yelled, and when No-Face entered its greed/consumption loop they both agreed it was good we waited to watch it. They both commented on the animation in a wistful way, nothing how long it must have taken to produce. At numerous times they remarked, “I know this from a meme”. Afterwards S just kept saying, “what did I just watch?” but in a fascinated way. Maybe we’ll swing for _Mononoke_ next.
