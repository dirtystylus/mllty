Wrapped up the trilogy with my youngest. I guess I’m used to the Extended version because it felt oddly rushed to me? (Weird saying that about a 3+ hour movie). Anyway, we made it to the end and our count was still sadly stuck at four (!!!!) named female characters: Arwen, Galadriel, Eowyn, Rosie.

Maybe it’s because his passing is still so recent but Bernard Hill as Theoden was a real standout for me this time through the trilogy. When he yells “Ride now!” while dragging his sword across the line of spears, I got chills. When he talks about no longer being ashamed to join the company of his fathers…woof. How we got these movies and they came together so well is just a gift, and I’m just so sad about the blockbusters we’re sold today.
