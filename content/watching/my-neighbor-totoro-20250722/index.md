First time seeing this in the theater, as part of Ghibli Fest. The projection was just slightly off-focus but did nothing to diminish my delight. Watched this with my youngest and the two of us were charmed by the familiar beats but also the parts that weâ€™d forgotten. Miyazaki is always a great proponent of public transit.
