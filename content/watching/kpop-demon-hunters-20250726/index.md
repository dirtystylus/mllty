I’d been trying to get the kids to watch this since they love Sony Animation’s work on the Spider-verse films. A bit too reliant on well-worn tropes — why are the supposed love interests in these stories always hundreds of years old? Do we just hunger for vampire lover stories in different clothing?

Ten minutes in Jordan said “this is just _Jem and the Holograms_ meets _Turning Red_ but with demons, though, right?” and I do not disagree. Everyone had a good time, though. Tiger/bird buddies forever.
