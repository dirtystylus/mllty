Filled with so many “I wonder how they did that” moments—a stew of Looney Tunes, video games, and adventure movies (the last act certainly evokes any of your favorite “sneak into the enemy lair” setups, from _Star Wars_ to _The Incredibles_). I loved the low-budget ingenuity, particularly the use of animation and plushies (!). Big beaver brawl setpiece truly a cinematic achievement. The perfect chaser to _There Will Be Blood_, because that was one milkshake that left me with heartburn.
