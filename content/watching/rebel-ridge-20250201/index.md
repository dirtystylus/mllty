_This review may contain spoilers._

When I watched _In the Heat of the Night_ a few weeks ago I immediately knew I wanted to watch this soon afterwards. Aaron Pierre—what a screen presence (I really need to watch _The Underground Railroad_). First half of the movie is definitely stronger than the end, and the “good” cops riding in to save the day ultimately has it coming down in a-few-bad-apples territory. That (along with the need for a non-lethal protagonist) shows the limits of what you can show onscreen in 2025. I actually wonder if you could even get this movie made today on a major streamer like Netflix, which is hard to imagine given that it was only released last year?

(Feels like there should have been at least one other acronym that Terry spelled out when interacting with the cops.)
