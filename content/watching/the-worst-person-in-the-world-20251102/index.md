Found out from watching the Criterion extras that Anders Danielsen Lie is a practicing doctor, ellewoods-whatlikeitshard.gif.

Still very much enjoy this movie, even though I think the voiceover undercuts the performances sometimes. The arresting visual moments — blowing smoke into a waiting mouth, the time-freezing sequence — are still high points but what stuck with me this time were the quieter moments where Reinsve, Lie, and Nordrum get space to convey emotion, often without words.

[This essay](https://www.rogerebert.com/features/the-lonely-landscapes-of-materialists-and-the-worst-person-in-the-world) (The Lonely Landscapes of “Materialists” and “The Worst Person in the World”) by Alisha Mughal is well worth your time. I thought of it while watching the film, asking myself why Julie doesn’t have any close friends. (Also very appropriate given that Dakota Johnson is Renate Reinsve’s American doppelgänger.)
