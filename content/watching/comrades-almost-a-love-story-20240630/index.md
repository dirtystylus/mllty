Glad I caught this before it left the Criterion Channel. Maggie Cheung in romantic melodrama mode? Say no more. The final scenes had my heart pounding with anxiety, this is my _Uncut Gems_. Trying to figure out where I can get a copy of this on disc.

(Watched as part of Criterionâ€™s Hong Kong in New York collection.)
