Feels like there’d be easier ways to start a galactic war?

There’s a lot of buildup to a final act that feels oddly paced. There were moments that I wanted to see dramatized that are resolved offscreen, obscured by a cloud of smoke. And then there’s confrontations between supporting characters that feel rushed.

But mostly I wonder about silly stuff, like how the Fremen get their people onto the worms for the caravan ride to the south—are they somehow easier to control once they’ve been roped? Are there worms that are better for commutes?
