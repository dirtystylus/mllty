I thought I had seen this before, but I was wrong. Everyone is at a fever pitch here except Arquette—Cage and Sizemore are especially manic in their scenes together.

The ambulance shift with Ving Rhames was my favorite section. Loved seeing him in this mode as opposed to his lower-key work in the Missions Impossible.

There’s one scene that clearly references Mary, Joseph, and Jesus, but with a twist—there’s so many layers to the scene and I’m still trying to figure out what it means. 

The way this movie is shot and edited—it’s kinetic but utterly comprehensible. It’s not all adrenaline rush, though—there’s a quieter scene with Cage that feels almost like a slow dance and I shook my head in appreciation.

(Watched as part of Criterion’s 1999 collection.)
