It feels like I end up rewatching this every time I dive into a new season of _Andor_. The more I see this, the more I focus on Tom Wilkinson’s Arthur. The scene where he loops the uNorth ad music to provide the backdrop to his phone call that then continues as the underlying score…brilliant!

Interested to revisit _Duplicity_ next.
