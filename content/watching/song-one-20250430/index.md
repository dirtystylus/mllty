Watched this on a lark after _Emma_ to continue the “film with Johnny Flynn playing music” vibes. I know this got a lot of “diet John Carney” reviews but I found it pleasant enough. Looked up who wrote the songs afterwards and it turns out Jenny Lewis had a hand in those, so that was fun. Anne Hathaway is using those big, expressive eyes to full effect.
