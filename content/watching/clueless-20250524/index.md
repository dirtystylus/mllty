Perfect adaptation, really helps that I saw ADW’s _Emma._ recently.

The way Heckerling writes Cher really captures the essence of the Emma character, which is that she is (to borrow ADW’s framing) very intelligent but extremely sheltered and quite, uh, clueless about so many things. Heckerling gives Cher an expansive vocabulary and an observant nature, matched to hilariously silly behavior.

My main quibble this time: the 90s thin-is-in culture is _really_ front and center in the dialogue sometimes.

(So much Radiohead!)
