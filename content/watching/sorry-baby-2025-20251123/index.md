If I did stars this would easily have gotten an extra star just because my family recently adopted a cat. Eva Victor can really write a scene, and there’s a couple of really funny ones here despite the overarching darkness hanging over her character Agnes. Very visually interesting as well. The thing that A24 used to do best, before they decided they wanted make bigger movies.
