The new 4K LE is in a ridiculously tall digibook. Loved the look of it, I miss this era of stuff shot on film. I know you can make digital look like film (see another Austen adapation, Autumn De Wilde’s _Emma._) but that takes a crew that knows how film looks and behaves. Lots of showy tracking shots, but I’m a sucker for those.

RIP Donald Sutherland.
